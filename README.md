FWS-HydroModel Dataset

Author: Mahtab Ahmadian  
Software: COMSOL Multiphysics v6.1  

Files:
- FWS_HydroModel_BaseCase(BasinA.mph)**: Base model setup with flat bed and no obstruction. (Due to large file size, only one representative basin model is provided.)
- velocity_field.csv**: Exported velocity components (U, V) at steady state.
- concentration-outlet.csv**: Tracer concentration distribution at the outlet (dimensionless).

Data Access:
A sample dataset, including the representative COMSOL model, is hosted on Zenodo:
