Constructed Wetland COMSOL Model
This repository contains documentation, supporting scripts, and small result files for the constructed wetland COMSOL models.

Full COMSOL model files are hosted on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17272097
Note: Due to the large size of the full COMSOL files, only one representative model has been uploaded to Zenodo. This file includes all essential components needed to reproduce the study.

This repository is intended to provide guidance, scripts, and example results to complement the Zenodo dataset.
